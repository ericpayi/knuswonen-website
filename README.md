## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Git**

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ericpayi/knuswonen-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   After cloning, navigate into the project directory using:
   ```bash
   cd knuswonen-project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will read the `package.json` file and install the dependencies listed there.

4. **Start the Development Server**
   Start the project locally by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start a local development server and automatically open the project in your default web browser. The development server will reload automatically whenever you make changes to the project files.

5. **Build the Project for Production**
   If you want to create a production-ready version of the project, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate an optimized build of the project in a `build/` directory, which you can then deploy to a server.


6. **Deploying the Project(Optional)**
   To deploy the project, you can upload the contents of the `build/` directory to your hosting provider or server. Ensure that your hosting environment supports static file serving.
